# Global Config for Homekit Infused 2020

# Vacuum View

# How to use?
# To edit a view open one of the global config files to the corresponding view. Editing views can be done simply by editing this file!
# ALL items are commented! This is done because commented items will revert to the default configuration. The default configuration is
# set up by myself. It tries to show as much of the interface as possible without the need for you to edit the views. You will ofcourse
# want to set it up yourself. Using it this way makes it possible to only change what you want to change. E.g. You only want to change
# the icons on the buttons of the frontpage? Well you will only need to uncomment the item in the list below and put in your own config!
# DO NOT EVER COMMENT THE CURRENTLY UNCOMMENTED LINES, DO NOT REMOVE THEM EITHER!

# Before you continue I will recommend you to use VSCode as a text editor https://code.visualstudio.com/

# Maps
## Xiaomi Vacuum Map Card
vacuum_map:
#  map_type: camera # Choose either between `camera` or `map` (without the quotes). This will determine if the above setting is a camera entity or an image location.
#  map_image: camera.rockrobo_map # Can be either a camera entity or an image. Example when used with an image: `/local/images/xiaomi-map.png`. (You will need to get the map yourself some way https://community.home-assistant.io/t/xiaomi-vacuum-interactive-map-card/123901) 

# IMPORTANT!
