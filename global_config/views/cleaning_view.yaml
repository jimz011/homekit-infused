# Global Config for Homekit Infused 2020

# Cleaning View

# How to use?
# To edit a view open one of the global config files to the corresponding view. Editing views can be done simply by editing this file!
# ALL items are commented! This is done because commented items will revert to the default configuration. The default configuration is
# set up by myself. It tries to show as much of the interface as possible without the need for you to edit the views. You will ofcourse
# want to set it up yourself. Using it this way makes it possible to only change what you want to change. E.g. You only want to change
# the icons on the buttons of the frontpage? Well you will only need to uncomment the item in the list below and put in your own config!
# DO NOT EVER COMMENT THE CURRENTLY UNCOMMENTED LINES, DO NOT REMOVE THEM EITHER!

# Before you continue I will recommend you to use VSCode as a text editor https://code.visualstudio.com/
