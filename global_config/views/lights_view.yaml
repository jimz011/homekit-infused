# Global Config for Homekit Infused 2020

# Lights View

# How to use?
# To edit a view open one of the global config files to the corresponding view. Editing views can be done simply by editing this file!
# ALL items are commented! This is done because commented items will revert to the default configuration. The default configuration is
# set up by myself. It tries to show as much of the interface as possible without the need for you to edit the views. You will ofcourse
# want to set it up yourself. Using it this way makes it possible to only change what you want to change. E.g. You only want to change
# the icons on the buttons of the frontpage? Well you will only need to uncomment the item in the list below and put in your own config!
# DO NOT EVER COMMENT THE CURRENTLY UNCOMMENTED LINES, DO NOT REMOVE THEM EITHER!

# Before you continue I will recommend you to use VSCode as a text editor https://code.visualstudio.com/

# Header
lights_header:
#  title: Lights
#  icon: fal:lamp-floor

# Button Sorting (you can choose either between: domain, entity_id, name, state, last_changed, last_updated or last_triggered.)
lights_sorting:
#  method: name

# Popup (change this number whenever an entity with a brightness attribute shows a switch instead of a slider).
# When the supported features of the entity is larger than the treshold, you'll see a slider. if it is equal or lower, you'll see a switch.
lights_popup:
#  supportedFeaturesTreshold: 9

# Lock (puts a lock on buttons and you will have to press twice, the first tap will unlock, the second tap will toggle the button.)
lights:
#  living_room_lock: false
#  bedroom_lock: true
#  office_lock: false
#  kitchen_lock: false
#  hallway_lock: false
#  other_lock: false

# Config
# The lights config is done through a template and groups. To make the lights view work, make sure that you have filled the hki_groups.yaml
# file. Without those groups this view will not work!
