  Before you continue you should [create persons](../config/person) and add pictures to them, this is not required, but it will make your top right button look more personalized.


  A user and person is created by default when starting Home Assistant for the first time, just make sure that the person and username are both 1 word, this is important. 
  
  If your username has underscores, create a new one with only your first name!
